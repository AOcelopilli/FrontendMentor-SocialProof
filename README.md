## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I practice the way to give styles from JavaScript, in this case the margin thinking about more than 5 items in the future.

### Continued development

Right now I'm practicing Flexbox and Grid, I'd like start to practice some frameworks of CSS like, boopstrap or tailwind and maybe use Sass.
